# WYVERN-E 4.0 — Simulation & Dataset Suite

Start from loaded:
cd ~/"Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Skylight/Projects/Skylight/WYVERN/WYVERN-E/Simulations/wyvern_datagen"
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 run_gui.py

One Python GUI + engine that generates **millions of atmospheric datapoints** for the WYVERN-E 4.0
rocket, and links the project's existing single-run simulation engines under the same window.

This replaces the old Java/OpenRocket `arc-sim` tool (which was wired to the CSW project — its
`CSWARCMOD*.ork` files have been removed). The physics here matches the project's canonical engine
`../we4_flightsim.py` (nominal apogee **132.6 m / 435 ft @ ~6.81 s**), so datasets are consistent
with the rest of the WYVERN sim suite.

## Quick start

Use **one** interpreter that has both a modern Tk (for the GUI) and the packages. On macOS that's
Homebrew's Python: `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local/bin/python3` (Intel).

**One-time setup** (installs the toolkit + packages into that interpreter):

```bash
brew install python-tk                                   # modern Tk 8.6 for the GUI
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -m pip install numpy pyarrow matplotlib   # (add --break-system-packages if pip refuses)
```

**Open the GUI** — pick either:

```bash
# a) double-click  launch.command  in Finder  (auto-picks a working Python), OR
# b) from a terminal:
cd ~/"Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Skylight/Projects/WYVERN/WYVERN-E/Simulations/wyvern_datagen"
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 run_gui.py
```

If a dependency is missing, `run_gui.py` prints the exact install command for *that* interpreter
instead of a traceback. Sanity check anytime:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -c "import numpy, pyarrow, matplotlib, tkinter; print('deps OK')"
```

**Headless / scriptable** (recommended for multi-million-row runs) — run from this folder. Each run
writes a new `*_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` file; add `--no-timestamp` to overwrite a fixed name instead:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 datagen.py outcomes   --n 2000000 --out datasets/outcomes.parquet
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 datagen.py timeseries --flights 50000 --stride 10 --out datasets/ts.parquet
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 datagen.py tvc        --n 1000000 --out datasets/tvc.parquet
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 datagen.py combined   --flights 25000  --out datasets/combined.parquet   # closed-loop SIL batch
```

## GUI at a glance

Opens maximized (fill screen); **F11** toggles true fullscreen, **Esc** exits it.

- **Atmospheric Datasets** — choose type, N flights, seed, format; one-click envelope **presets**
  (Calm / Typical field / High wind / Hot & high / Full envelope); Preview count + real ETA;
  progress bar, live log, working Cancel; "Quick nominal flight ▶" plots a single reference flight.
  Every run writes a **new timestamped file** (arc-sim style — never overwrites); untick "New file
  each run" to reuse a fixed name.
- **Plots & Analysis** — load any dataset (or "Load last generated") and build **histograms,
  scatter, density hexbin, altitude-trajectory overlays, and correlation heatmaps** in an embedded
  matplotlib canvas with the standard zoom/pan/**save-PNG** toolbar; per-column statistics panel.
  Large sets are auto-subsampled so plotting stays responsive.
- **Data Viewer** — a tabular **Parquet/CSV viewer** with a **dark grid** (white text on a dark
  background, white row/column outlines — rows drawn a touch thicker). Full column headers, numeric
  formatting + right-alignment, horizontal & vertical scrolling, **click-a-header-to-sort**, and a
  start-row / row-count window (**default 10,000 rows**). The grid is drawn on a virtualized canvas,
  so only on-screen rows render and it stays fast even on multi-million-row files. Also opens the
  last generated file.
- **PID Tuner** — live closed-loop TVC tuning: drag **Kp / Ki / Kd** (plus gimbal limit, wind,
  turbulence, and disturbance type) and watch the pitch θ(t) and gimbal δ(t) response redraw in
  real time, with tuning metrics (peak overshoot, settle time, steady-state error, RMS gimbal,
  saturation %) and the firmware-default gains overlaid for comparison. **Auto-tune** runs a robust
  multi-wind gain search (~10 s) and "Apply best" loads it; "Reset to firmware" restores Kp0.10/Ki0.40/Kd0.18.
- **Flight Computer SIL** — a software-in-the-loop *digital twin*: runs the FC's own processes
  (state machine BOOT→…→LANDED, 500 Hz PID on **noisy** simulated sensors, motor-ejection recovery)
  against a simulated flight with altitude-varying wind, and streams the **simulated Wi-Fi telemetry**
  (`HB:` heartbeat lines) to a live console while plotting altitude/pitch/gimbal. Shows true-vs-baro
  altitude, boost-phase control, and the apogee nose-over.
- **Super Combined** — batch-runs the full closed-loop SIL over **N random-condition flights**
  (default **25,000**), building a **live scatter** (wind vs boost-phase peak pitch, coloured by
  gimbal saturation) as flights complete, with progress + ETA + Cancel. Saves **two** timestamped
  files: the full time-series `*_log` and a compact per-flight `*_flights` summary. ~14 flights/s
  (25,000 ≈ 30 min); Cancel keeps whatever was written.
- **Static Motor Tester** — pick a motor (Estes C6/D12/E12/E16/F15) and see its thrust curve plus the
  **axial load-cell trace** the static stand would log (DAQ rate + sensor noise), with total impulse,
  avg/peak thrust, burn time, and a load-cell headroom/under-range check.
- **Jetvane Suitability** — screen a jetvane TVC against the servo gimbal: **side force** and **axial
  thrust loss** vs vane deflection, plus a **thermal-survival verdict** (printed PC-FR ablates in the
  ~1150 K black-powder exhaust; graphite/tungsten survive) and a suitability call.
- **Ground TVC + PID** — the **3-axis thrust-vector balance** reading (Fz axial, Fx/Fy lateral) while
  the firmware PID gimbals the nozzle through a bench maneuver (step / sweep / PID disturbance-reject),
  including servo lag; shows commanded-vs-measured δ, the resolved vector, saturation, and cell headroom.
- **Project Engines** — run the existing `we4_*.py` engines; each run archives its plots to a fresh
  `plots*_<timestamp>/` folder (set via the `WYVERN_RUN_TAG` env var) so nothing is overwritten.
- **About** — canonical specs + the headless CLI reference.

## Dataset types

| Type | Rows | Columns | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `outcomes`   | 1 per flight | sampled atmosphere → `apogee_m/ft`, `apogee_t`, `max_speed_ms`, `max_mach`, `max_q_pa`, `max_accel_g`, `burnout_*`, `deploy_*`, `descent_rate_ms`, `flight_time_s`, `landing_x_m`, `drift_from_pad_m` | dispersion / robustness statistics |
| `timeseries` | ~149 per flight (dt 5 ms, stride 10) | `flight_id, t, x, z, vx, vz, accel_g, mach, q` + per-row conditions | ML training / trajectory learning |
| `tvc`        | 1 per flight | `peak_pitch_err_deg`, `rms_gimbal_deg`, `gimbal_saturation_pct`, `settle_time_s` + conditions | closed-loop TVC control performance |
| `flightlog`  | SIL time-series | `state_id, alt, vz, pitch, gimbal, baro, batt` + conditions | closed-loop digital-twin logs (state machine + sensor noise) |
| `combined`   | log + per-flight summary | full SIL log **plus** `apogee, peak_pitch_boost, rms_gimbal, gimbal_sat, deployed` per flight | the Super Combined batch (default 25,000 flights) |

Every flight samples an atmosphere/launch condition uniformly over a tunable envelope (wind speed &
bearing, turbulence, surface temperature, pressure, launch-rod tilt, field elevation). The GUI
exposes every envelope bound; the defaults cover a realistic small-field F-class envelope.

## Physics (vectorized)

`core.py` integrates **N flights in lock-step as NumPy arrays** — that vectorization is what makes
million-flight datasets tractable in pure Python. It reuses the canonical WYVERN model:

- F15-4 thrust curve (49.6 N·s / 3.45 s), linear propellant burn, `m_lift 705 g → m_dry 603 g`.
- Barrowman drag build-up (Cd ≈ 0.54), ISA atmosphere with sampled temperature/pressure perturbation.
- 2-D point mass with wind drift; analytic 18″-parachute descent (terminal ≈ 6 m/s) after the
  F15-4 ejection at t = 7.45 s.
- **TVC**: reduced-order closed-loop pitch plant (aerodynamic angle-of-attack spring + damping +
  the firmware PID `Kp0.10/Ki0.40/Kd0.18`, ±8° gimbal, 500 Hz, anti-windup), held straight on the
  1 m rail then released. Peak pitch error scales with wind (≈0° calm → ≈19° at 10 m/s), consistent
  with the documented low-speed weathercocking of this low-T/W vehicle.

Nominal check: `python3 core.py` → `132.6 m / 435 ft @ 6.81 s` (matches `we4_flightsim.py`).

## Throughput & scale

Measured on this dev machine (single core, NumPy):

| Dataset | Rate | 1 M rows | 10 M rows |
|---|---|---|---|
| outcomes (dt 5 ms) | ~8,600 flights/s | ~2 min | ~20 min |
| tvc (dt 2 ms, 500 Hz) | ~5,000 flights/s | ~3.5 min | ~35 min |
| timeseries (dt 5 ms) | ~90,000 rows/s | ~11 s | ~2 min |

Data is **streamed to disk in chunks**, so memory stays flat no matter how large the dataset. There
is no practical row cap — pick the row count you want and let it run.

## Output format

**Parquet** by default (compact, columnar, snappy-compressed — ideal for the huge time-series set and
loads directly into pandas/DuckDB/Polars). Falls back to **gzip-CSV** if `pyarrow` isn't installed.
Note: `.xlsx` is *not* used — it caps at ~1.05 M rows, well below "millions."

```python
import pyarrow.parquet as pq
df = pq.read_table("datasets/outcomes.parquet").to_pandas()
```
