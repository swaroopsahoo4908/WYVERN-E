# WYVERN-E 4.0 — Camera Solution

## The problem
The OV2640 over SPI (ArduCAM-style) cannot sustain 720p30 — SPI readout caps it at roughly VGA/SVGA
JPEG ~15–30 fps, or 720p at ~5–10 fps. Worse, running camera readout + SD writes on the same Pico
that closes the 500 Hz TVC loop steals deterministic CPU time from the control task.

## Decision — offload video to a self-contained thumb camera
Do **not** make the flight computer responsible for video. Use a self-contained thumb camera that
runs on **its own battery** and records to **its own microSD**, wholly independent of the FC:

- **As purchased: i3 4K Thumb Action Camera** (Amazon B0DDSH1W1N) — ~36 g, 4K, tiny thumb form factor
  with a spring clip, built-in battery + microSD. Self-contained, zero Pico load, guaranteed clean
  footage, and fits the 66 mm-ID bay. Viewport cut in the FC-bay body wall, aimed outward/slightly
  down. Chosen over a ~10 g RunCam Thumb-class cam purely on cost.
  ⚠ **Mass note (folded into the flight numbers):** the i3 is ~26 g heavier than the ~10 g thumb-cam
  the budget originally assumed. This has been **carried through the whole cascade** — FC bay 96 → 122 g,
  liftoff 679 → **705 g**, apogee 471 → **435 ft**, T/W 2.16/3.80 → **2.08/3.66**. Because the camera
  sits at ~0.42 m (forward of the 0.49 m CG), the aft-CG shift is *favourable*: static margin rises
  from 1.04 to **1.10 cal** (more stable). Net: a small altitude/TWR cost for the cheaper camera, with
  a slight stability *gain*.
- **Keep the OV2640 as *optional***: only if you want a few Pico-grabbed JPEG frames time-synced
  to the flight log for a telemetry overlay — run it at VGA, low fps, best-effort (never blocking
  the control loop). It is **not** the flight video source.

## Why this is the right call
1. The TVC loop keeps 100 % of the Pico's real-time budget.
2. Video quality is decoupled from the SPI/SD bottleneck → reliable 1080p/4K.
3. Fully self-contained (own battery + card + one viewport); no FC power rail or wiring involvement.
4. Cheapest self-contained 4K option; the ~26 g mass penalty is accounted for in the flight budget.

## Integration
The i3 runs on its own battery, so no FC power rail is required — start it manually (or via its
power-on-record mode) at the pad during the arming sequence. If you prefer bus power, it charges over
USB-5 V; confirm its record-on-power behaviour on the bench first.
Cut the viewport at the FC-bay station (≈ 38 cm from nose), lens flush with a thin ASA-Aero window
or open port. The Pico logs an arm timestamp so video and sensor logs can be aligned in post.
